As such, the combination of datasets and the approaches used for solving are often highly problem-specific. Some researchers develop inversion and parameter estimation algorithms that suit their needs and wonder where else they could be applied. Others focus on developing new and flexible forward models of Earth phenomena and want a complementary inversion algorithm that fits their needs. Many more of us have data and questions to answer and need both.\nOur aim with CoFI, the Common Framework for Inference, is to build a community collaboration using open-source platform agnostic infrastructure to interface geoscience inference problems with the tools required to solve them. In addition by creating an extensive set of demonstration problems and worked examples, we hope to support education at all levels in this space. CoFI will initially take the form of a Python package able to interface with inference algorithms from different sources. In addition, we are building an Inversion Test Suite which collects examples from many disciplines within geoscience and elsewhere. The connection points between the two is a common standard that is flexible and capable enough to accommodate a variety of inference problems which can be recognised by various solvers that comply with this same common framework.\nHaving the basic setup and several examples in place already, we hope to encourage more forward examples and inversion algorithms to be developed and be contributed to this modular designed framework, with the lowest possible barriers to participation.\n","date":"August 31, 2022","image":"https://inlab-geo.github.io/images/blog/post-3/iamg_2022_banner_hud5c1c4c8977a73e703699d99cbfb870c_3809384_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"/blog/post-3/","title":"IAMG 2022 CoFI Poster"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The development of CoFI is now being supported through an AuScope 2021 Pilot Project.\nIn the Common Framework For Inference project (CoFI), researchers will build an open and flexible software platform that enables the wider research community to more effectively undertake inversion (a tool to understand subsurface properties using field data). CoFI will also help educators to better teach inversion to geophysics students through the provision of interactive examples.\nCoFI will be the world\u0026rsquo;s first independent transportable framework for inversion, offering researchers a flexible high-level programming language that expresses inversion problems and connects them to solutions. Project leader, Professor Malcolm Sambridge from The ANU explains why this is so exciting:\n“Typically geoscience researchers who develop inversion methods need problems to test them on, and those who need to solve inversion problems need leading-edge algorithms to solve them. The idea behind CoFI is to allow the two to meet in the middle, while also providing an ease of use platform for educators. We are excited to be embarking on this new project, the first of its kind in the world, with our partners in AuScope and CSIRO.”\nCoFI will be a collaboration between The ANU, CSIRO’s Deep Earth Imaging Future Science Platform and the University of Durham.\nFor further explanation look here\nBegin exploring the development version of CoFI by heading to Colab\n","date":"December 7, 2021","image":"https://inlab-geo.github.io/images/blog/post-2/cofi_flyer_hu3927afc8dccc716c3b5d1e1c41cf69b8_423106_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/blog/post-2/","title":"CoFI "},{"categories":null,"contents":"Using polynomial regression as an example we explore how CoFI allows us to swap between fundamentally different inference and optimisation approaches without the need to redefine the problem.\nBackground CoFI Problem definition Trying different inverse problem solvers Conclusions ","date":"July 14, 2021","image":"https://inlab-geo.github.io/images/blog/post-2/cofi_flyer_hu3927afc8dccc716c3b5d1e1c41cf69b8_423106_650x0_resize_q100_box.jpg","permalink":"/showcase/tearing_down_barriers/","title":"Tearing down barriers..."},{"categories":null,"contents":"The American Geophysical Union has awarded the 2020 Gutenberg Lecture to Prof. Malcolm Sambridge.\nThe Beno Gutenberg Lecture is presented annually in recognition of outstanding contributions to the field of seismology.
